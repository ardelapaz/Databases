1)  SUM - Returns the sum of the values in a given column.
    AVG - Returns the average of the values in a given column.
    COUNT - Returns the total numbers of values (length of list) in a column.
    MIN - Returns the lowest value in a column.
    MAX - Returns the largest value in a column.

2)  a.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations;

    b.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor;

    *c. SELECT AVG(amount) 
        FROM donations 
        GROUP BY donor;

    d. SELECT COUNT(amount)
        FROM donations
        WHERE amount > 100;     

    e. SELECT MAX(amount)
       FROM donations; 

    f. SELECT MIN(amount)
       FROM donations; 

3)  The data is returned in the order it is in the table if returning multiple values unless it's being sorted or manipulated by another aggregate function.


4)  If you know that your table might have extraneous values, you can use offset to exclude a set amount of values from your query.


5)  Using "Order By" allows you to sort the returned values by ascending(default) or decending order. Sorted data is always easier to use and manipulate.


6)  WHERE filters data before aggregate functions, and HAVING filters data after the aggregate functions are complete.


7)  SUM (amount), id
    FROM payment
    WHERE SUM amount > 200


8)  a.  SELECT *
        FROM cats
        ORDER BY intake_date;


    b. SELECT cat FROM adoptions ORDER BY date LIMIT 5;


    c.  SELECT gender, adoption_date
        FROM cats
        WHERE gender='F' AND adoption_date IS NULL AND age > 2;

    d.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor
        LIMIT 5;


    e.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor
        LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;

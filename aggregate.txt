1)  SUM - Returns the sum of the values in a given column.
    AVG - Returns the average of the values in a given column.
    COUNT - Returns the total numbers of values (length of list) in a column.
    MIN - Returns the lowest value in a column.
    MAX - Returns the largest value in a column.

2)  a.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        WHERE date > DATEADD(year,-1,GETDATE());

    b.  SELECT donor, SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor;

    *c. SELECT donor, AVG(amount) 
        FROM donations 
        GROUP BY donor;

    d.  SELECT COUNT(amount)
        FROM donations
        WHERE amount > 100;     

    e.  SELECT donor, MAX(amount) as max
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor
        ORDER BY max DESC
        LIMIT 1;

    f.  SELECT donor, MIN(amount) as min
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor
        ORDER BY min
        LIMIT 1;

3)  The data returned will be in the order it is in the database unless you use an ORDER BY statement to sort the returned data on a set column by ascending (ASC) or decending (DESC) order at the end of your select statement:
        
        SELECT *
        FROM table
        ORDER BY rank (ASC / DESC)


4)  If you know that your table might have extraneous values, you can use offset to exclude a set amount of values from your query.


5)  Using "Order By" allows you to sort the returned values by ascending(default) or decending order. Sorted data is always easier to use and manipulate.


6)  WHERE filters data before aggregate functions, and HAVING filters data after the aggregate functions are complete.


7)  SELECT id, SUM (amount)
    FROM payment
    GROUP BY id
    HAVING SUM (amount) > 200;


8)  a.  SELECT *
        FROM cats
        ORDER BY intake_date;

    b.  SELECT cat 
        FROM adoptions 
        ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;

    c.  SELECT name, age, adoption_date
        FROM cats
        WHERE gender='F' AND adoption_date IS NULL AND age > 2;

    d.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor
        ORDER BY sum DESC
        LIMIT 5;


    e.  SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM donations
        GROUP BY donor
        ORDER BY sum DESC
        LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
